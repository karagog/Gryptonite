   Gryptonite

   This product comprises of software developed at home by George Karagoulis.

   This software links to a static library from another open source project 
   called "crypto++".
   
   It was also built and distributes with with the Qt application 
   framework, which is as well an open source initiative.
   
   This was built for my own purposes, but I am sharing it altruistically
   with the rest of the world.  Enjoy my generosity, but don't take it for
   granted!
