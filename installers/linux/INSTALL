You can install Gryptonite by executing "install.bash"

The files will be copied to /usr/local/lib/gryptonite (no other location will work),
so you will need administrator privileges.

example:
    cd <gryptonite package directory>
    sudo ./install.bash

You can run it by executing /usr/local/bin/gryptonite

An uninstaller is included with the library files. You can uninstall everything by executing:

    sudo /usr/local/lib/gryptonite/uninstall.bash

Enjoy!
