You can install Gryptonite by executing "install.bash"

The files will be copied to /usr/local/lib/gryptonite (no other location will
work, unless you compile it with a different rpath), so you will need 
administrator privileges to install.

example:
    cd <gryptonite package directory>
    sudo ./install.bash

You can run it by executing "gryptonite" in /usr/local/bin, which is a short 
bash script that calls the executable in /usr/local/lib/gryptonite.

FYI there is another executable included alongside gryptonite called grypto_transforms,
which is just the cryptographic transformation window without the full rest of the
gryptonite application. It is not included in the path, but you can find it and make
your own link to it in /usr/local/lib/gryptonite

An uninstaller is included with the library files. You can uninstall everything by executing:

    sudo /usr/local/lib/gryptonite/uninstall.bash

Enjoy!
