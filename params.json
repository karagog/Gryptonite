{"name":"Gryptonite","tagline":"The next version of GPassword Manager, with a better interface, more secure encryption and less cumbersome name.","body":"<h1>Gryptonite (formerly GPassword Manager)</h1>\r\n\r\nSecure, cross-platform application for managing secrets such as passwords, credit card\r\nnumbers, PIN numbers and files. It can pretty much hold any data you want to keep\r\nsecret, and protects it with a single master password and/or keyfile.\r\n\r\nFeatures include (but not limited to):\r\n<ul>\r\n <li>One of the most secure encryption algorithms around - AES with CCM</li>\r\n <li>Favorite entries are made available directly in the tray icon</li>\r\n <li>Hash calculator with all major hash functions</li>\r\n <li>Crypttext generator and interpreter - Encrypt/Decrypt any strings or files you want</li>\r\n <li>Random password generator with customizable character set</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>A note from the developer</h3>\r\n\r\nThis has been my brainchild since I started it in 2009. I am a computer engineer, and\r\nwhen I graduated from college I could write embedded code but had no idea how to\r\nimplement a GUI. Originally called GPassword Manager, I used this application as a\r\nstarter project for me to learn GUI development in C++. I released a couple versions\r\nand then took a long break from the project to work on other things. One day while\r\nrevisiting the code for nostalgia purposes I realized just how bad the code was -\r\ndespite the application being nice and easy to use. It wasn't just bad coding \r\npractices (like having no distinguishable layers, or storing pointers in integers...)\r\nbut I also noticed the encryption was haphazard and unsecure. I spent the next couple\r\nyears completely rearchitecting everything - I practically threw everything out and\r\nstarted from scratch.\r\n\r\nThe new application - Gryptonite - is a vast improvement over GPassword Manager in\r\nevery aspect. The encryption is MUCH more secure, the database backend is multithreaded\r\nfor optimal responsiveness and I fully implemented storing files in the database,\r\nwhich was not possible in the old database format. I really hope you enjoy the new\r\nversion, as this application has been a big part of my life since 2009, both as a\r\ndeveloper and a user.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=QW8CL5QNL6EBL&lc=US&item_name=Gryptonite&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted\">\r\n    <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n<img src=\"http://s1.softpedia-static.com/_img/sp100free.png\"/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
